    "\n",
    "A vehicle insurance policy is effectively a contract between an individual and an insurance company whereby the individual agrees to pay premiums in exchange for protection against financial losses resulting from an accident or other damage to the vehicle.\n",

    "## The business model\n",
    "\n",
    "In return for the payment of a premium, the insurance company agrees to pay the policyholder's losses under the person policy. <br>\n",
    "Individual policies are priced differently to allow customers to choose coverage levels that closely suit their needs and budget. <br>\n",
    "Policy terms generally range between six and twelve months. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insurance premiums\n",
    "There are two primary costs associated with purchasing car insurance: premiums and deductibles.<br>\n",
    "Auto insurance premiums vary depending on age, gender, years of driving experience, accident and moving violation history, and other factors.\n",

    "## Insurance & \"The Law of Large Numbers\" \n",
    "Insurance companies rely on the law of large numbers to help estimate the value and frequency of future claims they will pay to policyholders.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything runs smoothly, insurance companies operate smoothly, consumers pay fair and accurate premiums, and the financial system as a whole remains stable. However, in practice, the theory of the law of large numbers does not always hold. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the Law of Large Numbers, the average of a large number of results closely reflects the expected value. This gap narrows as more results are introduced. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are a large number of policyholders in an insurance company, the actual loss will equal the expected loss.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance companies use the features mentioned earlier to determine how likely policyholders are to file future claims. And those decisions directly affect their business performance. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** - in the real world. There are additional factors that influence the firm's performance and profits.<br>\n",
    "For simplicity, in our project, we will define the firm's profitability as the expected return for policies.\n",
